# This is a LAMMPS input script to test the "cosine/squared" pair style.
#
# It generates 3 output files:
#
#  - "interaction_wca.dat" which contains the output of the "pair_write" command and
#     which the "plot_interaction.py" uses as the input for generating a plot of
#     the style's potential and force (with "wca")
#
#  - "interaction_no_wca.dat" which is the same as above only without the "wca" option
#     selected
#
#  - "test.xyz" which contains the dumps from a short simulation of 20 particles (with
#     effective radius of 1.0) interacting via the "cosine/squared" interaction. Half of
#     them (type 1) have the "wca" option included, and the other half (type 2) don't, and
#     there is no cross interaction (so two blobs should form)
